# **Customer Segmentation**

## **Project Overview**
The task in this project is to identify major customer segments on a transactional data set which contains all the transactions occurring between 01/12/2010 and 09/12/2011 for a UK-based and registered non-store online retail. The company mainly sells unique all-occasion gifts. Many customers of the company are wholesalers.

## **Need for Customer Segmentation**
The differences in customers' behavior, demographics, geographies, etc. help in classifying them in groups. Learning about different groups in the customer can help with the following:

- Target Marketing
- Client understanding
- Optimal product placement
- Revenue growth

Segmentation allows businesses to make better use of their marketing budgets, gain a competitive edge over rival companies, and demonstrate better knowledge of their customer's needs and wants.

## **Approach and Methodology**
Implemented clustering using K-means to identify three customer segments on data to optimize the impact of marketing campaigns.
Tried DBscan agglomerative hierarchical clustering to cluster the contents and used the elbow method and silhouette score for evaluation.
Used RFM modeling.

## **Conclusion**
Using a recency, frequency, and monetary (RFM) analysis, the customers have been segmented into various clusters.
By applying different clustering algorithms to our dataset, we get the optimal number of clusters is equal to 3.
The business can focus on these different clusters and provide customer with services of each sector in a different way, which would not only benefit the customers but also the business at large.

## **Insights from Descriptive Analysis**
- Missing and duplicate values were found.
- Most of the purchases are from the United Kingdom.
- Most of the customers have purchased items in November, October, December, and the least number of purchases in April, January, February.
- Most of the customers purchase in the afternoon time.

## **Future Applications**
The same approach can be utilized for e-commerce, healthcare for grouping the customers depending on their similarities and personalized deals can be offered.
